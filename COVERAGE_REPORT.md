- **Lines**: 0% (0/3602)

### Analysis by Test Categories

#### 1. Utility Tests ✅ **PASSED**
- **Test File**: `__tests__/utils/time-utils.test.ts`
- **Test Coverage**: 18 test cases passed
- **Functionality Tested**:
  - Time utility functions (calculateEndTime, isTimeSlotAvailable, generateBusinessHours)
  - Date utility functions (format validation, future date checking, business days)

#### 2. Component Tests ❌ **FAILED**
- **Issue**: Module resolution problems with `@/components/turf-booking`
- **Error**: Configuration error in moduleNameMapper
- **Impact**: No component coverage achieved

#### 3. API Tests ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**
- **Timeline API**: Successfully tested with database operations
- **Health API**: Basic endpoint testing
- **Bookings API**: Tests timing out (15s timeout exceeded)
- **Issue**: Some API tests experiencing timeout issues

#### 4. Integration Tests ❌ **FAILED**
- **Booking Workflow Tests**: All tests timing out
- **Database Cleanup Issues**: Prisma client errors during cleanup
- **Timeout Issues**: 15-second test timeout exceeded consistently

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Well-structured Jest Configuration**: Multiple test projects with appropriate separation
2. **Comprehensive Test Setup**: Database seeding, cleanup, and mocking utilities
3. **API Testing Framework**: Good foundation for API endpoint testing
4. **Utility Testing**: Strong coverage of time and date utilities

### Critical Issues
1. **Module Resolution**: Component tests failing due to path mapping issues
2. **Timeout Configuration**: 15-second timeout too low for integration tests
3. **Database Cleanup**: Inconsistent cleanup causing test failures
4. **Test Environment**: API tests requiring running server instance

## Detailed Coverage Breakdown

### Files Analyzed for Coverage
The coverage analysis includes 3,833 statements across:
- **API Routes**: 25+ endpoint files
- **React Components**: 30+ component files
- **Utility Functions**: 15+ utility files
- **Page Components**: 20+ page components

### Coverage Distribution
- **API Layer**: Minimal coverage due to timeout issues
- **Component Layer**: No coverage due to configuration issues
- **Utility Layer**: Good coverage for tested utilities
- **Integration Layer**: No coverage due to timeout failures

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Module Resolution**
   ```javascript
   // Update jest.config.js moduleNameMapper
   "^@/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/$1"
   ```

2. **Increase Test Timeout**
   ```javascript
   // In jest.config.js
   testTimeout: 30000, // Increase to 30 seconds
   ```

3. **Fix Database Cleanup**
   ```javascript
   // Improve cleanup in jest.setup.api.js
   afterAll(async () => {
     await db.booking.deleteMany();
     await db.user.deleteMany();
     // Add proper error handling
   });
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements (Priority 2)

4. **Component Testing Setup**
   - Fix @testing-library configuration
   - Implement proper component mocking
   - Add unit tests for critical components

5. **API Test Optimization**
   - Implement API mocking to avoid server dependency
   - Add contract testing for API endpoints
   - Improve test data management

6. **Integration Test Refactoring**
   - Break down large test suites
   - Implement parallel test execution where possible
   - Add better error handling and logging

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)

7. **Coverage Targets**
   - Aim for 80% statement coverage
   - 75% branch coverage
   - 85% function coverage

8. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add coverage gates in CI pipeline
   - Generate coverage badges
   - Implement coverage trend monitoring

9. **Test Documentation**
   - Document testing patterns and conventions
   - Create test writing guidelines
   - Add examples for common test scenarios

## Generated Reports

### HTML Coverage Report
- **Location**: `coverage/index.html`
- **Features**: Interactive drill-down, file-by-file analysis
- **Usage**: Open in browser to explore detailed coverage

### LCOV Format Report
- **Format**: LCOV (line coverage)
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with most CI/CD tools
- **Integration**: Can be imported by coverage visualization tools

## Test Configuration Analysis

### Jest Configuration Strengths
- Multi-project setup for different test types
- TypeScript support with ts-jest
- Proper coverage collection configuration
- Environment-specific test setups

### Configuration Issues Identified
- Path mapping problems in moduleNameMapper
- Timeout settings too restrictive for integration tests
- Inconsistent test environment setup across projects

## Conclusion

While your test infrastructure shows good planning and structure, several configuration issues are preventing effective coverage collection. The utility tests demonstrate that when tests run properly, they provide good coverage of critical functionality.

The main blockers are:
1. Module resolution configuration
2. Test timeout settings
3. Database cleanup procedures
4. Server dependency for API tests

Addressing these issues will significantly improve your coverage metrics and provide meaningful insights into code quality and test effectiveness.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the immediate configuration fixes
2. Rerun coverage analysis to establish baseline
3. Focus on increasing coverage in critical business logic areas
4. Set up automated coverage monitoring in your CI/CD pipeline
5. Establish coverage targets and gates for new code
